Changes: 

1. Modify data() to keep track of persistence status. Basically, weâ€™ll want to know if the app is
currently loading, is currently saving, or encountered an error during either operation.
2. Make a request using our API client to get any previously persisted data and load it into our
data().
3. Update our submitForm() event handler to trigger a save.
4. Change our component template so that the Submit button reflects the current save status and
prevents the user from performing an unwanted action like a double-save, as well as display a
loading indicator in the items list when data is still being fetched.
